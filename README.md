# I Ate Humans

## The Game
It's the end of the world. YOU finally made it. Zombies everywhere. Almost.
Some stupid Humans are still alive and menacing your zombipocalipse. Help your greenish friends to win one more time !

They are quite stupid, so keep the orders simple : a left clic will produce a scared scream that will attract zombies as surely as cheese attracts mice. A right clic on the opposite will scare them the hell off away from that nasty sawchain noise.

## Download and install
You can play the game by downloading the [exe file](https://github.com/iLambda/ldjam33/blob/master/i_ate_umans.exe) and its [data folder]https://github.com/iLambda/ldjam33/tree/master/IAteUman_Data on this repo.
